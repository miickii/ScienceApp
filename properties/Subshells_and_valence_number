PERIOD, SHELLS, SUBSHELLS AND ELECTRON CONFIGURATIONS
------------------------------------------------------

Period - number of shells in atom.

Shell - energy level (the higher the energy level of the shell the farther it is from the nucleus)
the outer most shell of an atom will have the valence electrons): All shells have an s value

E.g. 1s (first electron in shell 1), 2s (first electron in shell 2), 3s (first electron in shell 3), and so on.....
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUBSHELLS
---------
Subshells/sublevel - shells are further divided into subsets of electrons called subshells. The first shell has only one subshell,
the second shell has two subshells, the third shell has three subshells, and so on. The subshells of each shell are labeled, in order,
with the letters s, p, d, and f. Thus, the first shell has only an s subshell, the second shell has an s and a p subshell,
the third shell has s, p, and d subshells, and so forth.

Subshells and their maximum number of electrons:
// s - max 2 electrons, every shell contains this subshell
// p - max 6 electrons, 2nd shell and higher contain this subshell
// d - max 10 electrons, 3rd shell and higher contain this subshell
// f - max 14 electrons, 4th shell and higher contain this subshell
// g - max 18 electrons, 5th shell and higher contain this subshell (theoretically)

^ Superscript is used to denote how many electrons are in a subshell.
E.g. The Hydrogen atom has a single electron in s subshell of shell 1, and 1s^1 would be used to describe the electron configuration.

EXAMPLES
Helium - 1s^2 (s subshells can hold 2 electrons, so helium has 2 electrons in the first subshell of the first shell)
Lithium - 1s^2, 2p^1 (Lithium is in shell 2 meaning that it has 2 subshells, 2 electrons go in 1st subshell s, and 1 electron goes in 2nd subshell p)

The next largest atom, beryllium, has 4 electrons, so its electron configuration is 1s22s2.
Now that the 2s subshell is filled, electrons in larger atoms start filling the 2p subshell.
Thus, the electron configurations for the next six atoms are as follows:
B: 1s22s22p1
C: 1s22s22p2
N: 1s22s22p3
O: 1s22s22p4
F: 1s22s22p5
Ne: 1s22s22p6

CONDENSED NOTATION
------------------
A condensed notation for writing the electron configuration of an atom, is by writing: [noble gas before it] and the remainder of the subshells
Lithium is the element after the noble gas Helium, so the electron configuration can be written: [He] 2s^1 with this notation it's basically the electron configuration for the atom written in [] plus whats written next to it.

Example with Fe:
electron configuration for Fe = 1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6 4s^2 3d^6
The noble gas before Fe is Ar. Ar will already have [1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6], so we just need to add the remainders: [Ar] 3d^6 4s^2

// Transition element - element whose atom has an incomplete d subshell
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Shell 1s corresponding S-subshell: The electron with lowest energy is in the first shell. The first electron in the S-shell is the electron with lowest energy and is written as 1s
// Shell 2s corresponding S-subshell: The electron with lowest energy in this shell will be written as 2s.


// 4s^2 (2 electrons in first subshell of shell 4)
// 3p^6 (6 electrons in second subshell of shell 3)
// 3d^10 (10 electrons in third subshell of shell 2)

// E.g. Fe (Period 4) has:
// Shell 1 - 1s^2
// Shell 2 - 2s^2, 2p^6
// Shell 3 - 3s^2, 3p^6, 3d^6
// Shell 4 - 4s^2  (the reason for why we denote 3d^2 in the 4th shell and not 3rd , is because the energy level is so similar)
